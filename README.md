# Cuda_Examples
In this repository I show different examples of how to apply basic CUDA operations to some problems, to learn how to manage the GPU.
 
## Laplace_equation
This code aims to implement a parallel version that solves the Laplace Diferential Ecuation using CUDA.

## Coupled Map Lattices
This project compares two different codes which simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of a one-dimensional coupled map lattice using the logistic map. The goal is to compare the computational efficiency between using only the CPU with using the GPU.
